Typed with TypeScript.

## Available scripts

In the project directory you can run:

### npm start.

Starts the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for viewing in a browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test:dev

Starts the test program in interactive view mode.

### npm test:prod.

Executes the test run while hiding the console.log

### npm run build.

Builds the application for production into the `build` folder.\
It properly connects React in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance.

The build is minified and file names include hashes.\
Your application is ready to deploy!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run coverage:dev

Starts the test run program in interactive view mode.
Builds a test coverage tree

### npm run coverage:prod.

Launches the program for running tests. Builds the test coverage tree and hides all console.log

### npm run eject

\*\*Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!

If you are not satisfied with your choice of build and configuration tool, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove a single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so that you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point you to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you are on your own.

You will never have to use `eject`. The advanced feature set is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments, and you should not feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool will not be useful if you can't adjust it when you are ready for it.

## To start the application

To start the application you will need to install all the dependencies associated with it with the command `npm i` and directly run with the command `npm start`
