# Test assignment for skills presentation

## Description.

Parses a table of prices from a CSV file. Sorts this table by service category and by nested criteria.

## Toolkit.

React was used to implement this assignment.\
CSS was used for styling.\
Redux with Thunk was used as the data store.\
JEST was used for testing.\
Typed with TypeScript.

## Available scripts.

In the project directory you can run:

### npm start.

Starts the application in development mode.\
Opens the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) page for viewing in a browser.

It will reload the page if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test:dev

Launches a test program in interactive view mode.

### npm test:prod.

Runs the test program while hiding the console.log

### npm run build.

Builds the application for production in the `build` folder.\
It properly connects React in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance.

The build is minified and file names include hashes.\
Your application is ready for deployment!

### npm run coverage:dev

Launches the test run program in interactive view mode.
Creates a test coverage tree

### npm run coverage:prod.

Runs a program to run tests. Builds test coverage tree and hides all console.log

### npm run eject

\*\*Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you "eject", you cannot go back!

If you are not satisfied with your choice of build and configuration tool, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove one assembly dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so that you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point you to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you are on your own.

You never have to use `eject`. The advanced feature set is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments, and you should not feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool will not be useful if you cannot set it up when you are ready for it.

## Launching the application

To start the application you will need to install all of its associated dependencies with the `npm i` command and directly run the `npm start` command.
